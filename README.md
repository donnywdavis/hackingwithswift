# Hacking With Swift Projects

Projects to work through the [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com) tutorials.

## Project 1
Use a table view controller to display a list of image names. Tapping an image name
will display a detail view controller to show the image. Both views are wrapped in
a split view controller to be able to work on the iPhone or iPad.

## Project 2
Simple game to display three flags. A random country is display in the navigation
controller title. Select the correct flag that corresponds to the country listed.
An alert controller is displayed to specify the results and a label displays the
score at the bottom of the view.

## Project 3
Copy of Project 1 to add an action button to show the share sheet for sharing the
photo in the detail view.

## Project 4
Use WKWebView to display a selected web page. Display button on the navigation
controller to display an action sheet with a list of sites to choose from. Add a
refresh button and a progress bar to the views tool bar.

## Project 5
Read a list of words from a file and shuffle them to select a random word. Display
word as the navigation controllers title. Use an action button to prompt for input.
Enter a word that can be created out of the word in the title. If the word is
valid then add the word to the table view.

## Project 6
a) Copy project 2 and use auto layout to control position of the flags in both
portrait and landscape mode.
b) Use the Visual Format Language to position some labels on the screen and adjust
for both portrait and landscape modes.
